# 📊 Billionaire Wealth Analysis

A comprehensive exploration of global billionaire wealth distribution using data science methodologies to uncover patterns, correlations, and predictive factors influencing extreme wealth accumulation.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project analyzes a realtime dataset of billionaires worldwide to understand:

- 🌍 **Geographic & Demographic Distribution**: Understanding how billionaire wealth is spread across regions and demographics.
- 🏭 **Industry-Specific Trends**: Identifying which industries dominate billionaire wealth.
- 📉 **Economic Correlations**: Examining how economic indicators influence billionaire status.
- 🔮 **Predictive Modeling**: Building regression models to determine key wealth accumulation factors.
- ⚖️ **Wealth Inequality**: Measuring inequality within the billionaire population using statistical metrics.

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 💰 Wealth Distribution

- **Extreme Concentration**: The top 0.1% of billionaires (~3 individuals) possess wealth exceeding **$109 billion** each.
- **Gini Coefficient**: Significant wealth inequality exists even among billionaires.
- **Regional Trends**: North America & Asia lead in billionaire count, while Europe shows strong representation.
- **Gender Disparity**: Only **12.5%** of billionaires are female, but no significant wealth difference between genders was found.

### 🏦 Industry Analysis

- **Technology**: One of the most lucrative sectors, with multiple billionaires in the top 10.
- **Finance & Investments**: A consistently stable wealth-generating industry.
- **Emerging Sectors**: Cryptocurrency & renewable energy are creating new billionaire wealth opportunities.

### 📊 Predictive Factors

- **Career Length**: Strong correlation between **age, career duration, and wealth accumulation**.
- **GDP Relationship**: Country-level economic indicators show moderate correlation with billionaire wealth.
- **Industry Impact**: Certain industries play a significant role in determining billionaire status.

## 📈 Analysis Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Exploration
- Cleaning and processing of raw billionaire data.
- Examining distributions of wealth, age, gender, and geographical factors.
- Creating visualizations to identify key demographic patterns.

### 2️⃣ Wealth Analysis
- Calculating wealth concentration metrics (percentiles, Gini coefficient).
- Performing statistical tests to identify key determinants of billionaire wealth.
- Analyzing wealth differences across industries, regions, and demographic groups.

### 3️⃣ Predictive Modeling
- Developing **regression models** to predict billionaire wealth.
- Evaluating multiple models:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Random Forest Regression**
  - **Gradient Boosting**
- Identifying key wealth predictors using feature importance analysis.
- Optimizing models using **Bayesian hyperparameter tuning**.

---

## 🔮 Model Performance

The best-performing model was a **Random Forest Regressor with Bayesian optimization**, achieving:

- **R² Score**: **0.99** (after log transformation of wealth variable).
- **Superior performance** over linear models due to complex non-linear relationships in wealth accumulation.

### 🎯 Top Predictive Features:
1. Wealth accumulation per year (**wealth/career_years**).
2. Age & career duration.
3. GDP-related economic indicators.
4. Industry-specific factors.
5. Geographic factors.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/billionaires-analysis.git
   cd billionaires-analysis
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Preprocess the data:
   ```bash
   cd src
   python process_pipeline.py
   ```
   This will generate the `df_cleaned.csv` file in the `data/processed/` directory, which is ready for analysis.
5. Run Jupyter Notebook and explore the analysis:
